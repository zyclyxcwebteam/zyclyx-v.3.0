  "overview": "The technology functions as a digital ledger based on a P2P network that enables various users to have consistent transaction records, each of which is time-stamped and linked to the previous block. With every transaction collection added, the data becomes another link in the chain. It's favored because it's a write-once system, making any transaction a verifiable and auditable record. We propose that this be generated for Financial Services, Smart Land, Retails, etc.",
