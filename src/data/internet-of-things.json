  "overview": "IoT includes a sensor, electronics, or software linked to the internet that can be remotely accessed. Our team generates Uniques Identifiers (UIDs), which lets the devices communicate and thus allows them to move data over a network without human to human interaction. IoT systems provide us with the ability to be more effective with the way we do things, saving us time and resources. Smart devices/ appliances, smart cities, self-driving vehicles, farming and more are included.",
